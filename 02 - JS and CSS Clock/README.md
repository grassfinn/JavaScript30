# JS30 Day 2 Things I learned from this lesson
* That you can use ```css transform-origin``` to change the anchor or the part of the piece it rotates on
* The formula to translate the hands to the degree is also neat ```(x / total (60 for min and sec 12 for hours) ) * 360 + 90; ```
* I've used the ```js Date(); ``` constructor before but it is also good to freshen up on it

## Room for Improvements
* Make the hand different sizes
* Ticking Sounds/ Hour sounds

## Creative Ideas
* Make some sort of time based game from it
* Personal Dashboard asset
* Pomodoro timer

### overall this is a nice project to learn some simple things and a good asset to add to a simple web app
